Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/releases) page.\r\n2. Download the latest release.\r\n3. Extract the zip file\r\n4. Move the \"IRremote\" folder that has been extracted to your libraries directory.\r\n5. Make sure to delete Arduino_Root/libraries/RobotIRremote. Where Arduino_Root refers to the install directory of Arduino. The library RobotIRremote has similar definitions to IRremote and causes errors.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n- TODO (Check examples for now)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIf you want to contribute to this project:\r\n- Report bugs and errors\r\n- Ask for enhancements\r\n- Create issues and pull requests\r\n- Tell other people about this library\r\n- Contribute new protocols\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nThe only way to contact me at the moment is by email: zetoslab@gmail.com\r\nI am not currently monitoring any PRs or Issues due to other issues but will respond to all emails.
